# CornerGrocer

This project was a simple C++ program that tracks how often items appear in a grocery list.  
It reads from a file, counts item frequency, and gives the user options to look up specific items,  
see a full list, view a histogram, and save the results to a backup file.

I think I did a good job keeping the code clean and organized, with clear functions and logical flow.  
If I were to improve anything, I’d use a `map` instead of parallel vectors for better efficiency and cleaner lookups.

The trickiest part was making sure the frequency counts lined up properly across the vectors,  
but once I worked out the indexing, it clicked.

This project helped reinforce file handling, basic data structures, and writing code that's easy to read and update—skills I’ll definitely use again.

I also made sure to comment where needed and keep the formatting clean to make it easy to come back to later.
